# NetflixSupplement

Programmed by Dorian Pistilli

Last Edited on 16 March, 2015

Chrome Extension that adds a button to netflix.com, allowing the user quick access to different lists of netflix content (best, newest, leaving soon, etc...). By clicking the links on the dropdown menu, the user remains on Netflix.com, but now with additional tabs of the list content he/she clicked on.

Contains a manifest file that is a JSON object in a format specified by Google Chrome. The icon popup itself is essentially just an HTML page w/ basic CSS and javascript (with some supplementary chrome functions). Again, all of this is designed to fit within Google's Chrome specifications, which can be found here https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/api_index

#### To-do List
- Edit links so that they don't ever show purple / use buttons instead
- Browse for new font
- Think of real name
- Find/Make new icon, and make it work specifically for all sizes
- Upload to Chrome Online MarketPlace

#### Known Bugs:
- Not really a bug - current site that extension works on is www.guimp.com,
which is a very small site that makes testing / refreshing much easier.
- It's certainly not the prettiest / most useful thing in the world. I really wish Netflix just had a stinkin' API that they didn't take down from some combo of laziness/stupidity/greed
