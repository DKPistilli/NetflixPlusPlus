# NetflixSupplement

- Programmer- Dorian Pistilli
- Last Edit- 16 March, 2015

Chrome Extension that adds a button to netflix.com, allowing 
the user quick access to lists of "best on netflix", "newest on netflix", 
"coming/leaving soon".

Contains a manifest file that is a JSON object in a format specified by Google Chrome. The icon popup itself is essentially just an HTML page w/ basic CSS and javascript (with some supplementary chrome functions). Again, all of this is designed to fit within Google's Chrome specifications, which can be found here https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/api_index

#To-do List
- Edit links so that they don't ever show purple
- Browse for new font
- Find/Make new icon, and make it work specifically for all sizes
- Upload to Chrome Online MarketPlace

#Known Bugs:
- Not really a bug - current site that extension works on is www.guimp.com,
which is a very small site that makes testing / refreshing much easier.
