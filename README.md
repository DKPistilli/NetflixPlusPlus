Purpose   : Chrome Extension that adds a button to netflix.com, allowing 
the user quick access to lists of "best on netflix", "newest on netflix", 
"coming/leaving soon"

#To-do List
- Edit links so that they don't ever show purple
- Browse for new font
- Find/Make new icon, and make it work specifically for all sizes
- Upload to Chrome

#Known Bugs:
- Not really a bug - current site that extension works on is www.guimp.com,
which is a very small site that makes testing / refreshing much easier.
